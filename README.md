üìù Main Code Structure

Setup: The game window is created, and its dimensions (800x600) and color are set.

Objects: The two paddles (player1, player2), the ball (ball), the center line (center_line), and the score display (score) are initialized.

Movement Functions: Functions for paddle movement are defined and bound to keyboard keys using window.onkeypress.

Game Loop: A continuous while True loop updates the ball's position, checks for collisions with walls and paddles, and updates the score when a goal is scored.
